# Modern C++ concurrency lib minimum tutorial
## Intro
Modern C++ includes built-in support for:
- [Thread](#thread)
- [Atomic](#atomic)
- [Mutex](#mutex)
- [Condition variable](#condition-variable)
- [Future](#future)

It's confuse when you see these classes, and I will write this note to record my learning process.  
(This is a simple tutorial for modern c++ beginner.)

## Thread
[Thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)) is the base of concurrency. Threads allow multiple functions to execute concurrently.

- [jthread](thread/README.md#stdjthread)
